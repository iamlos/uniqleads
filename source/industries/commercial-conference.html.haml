    %h2 Difference
    %p We have worked with a few commercial conference companies to understand that each conference has a unique proposition and target market. We also understand that this means there may be subtle differences between the primary and secondary market profiles you need to target.

    %h2 Make informed decisions based on your data
    %p We guarantee the quality of the contacts and companies researched because we not only have an internal audit team who check each person’s work on a daily basis but we have been specialising in the event management and commercial conference industry for several years.

    %h2 Our approach
    %p Before we start any project, we research the event topic and analyse market dynamics to understand who the target profiles are and why they will be interested in attending.
    %p For commercial conference companies, target markets are typically classified into primary and secondary markets (buy and sell side profiles) across horizontal or vertical industries or topics. Because each event topic and markets are unique, our staff research topics before they are scheduled to start on a project to ensure they don’t loose time climbing the conference topic ‘learning curve’ or research incorrect profiles.

    %h2 Difference
    %p  Vertical market events target senior executives within companies in one or a related industry. We believe that the key in identifying the correct companies is to understand the conference topic, why it is being held now and why delegates need to pay a premium to send delegates to the event. We apply a two­level qualification process to ensure the target market is adequately researched:
    %ul
      %li Qualify the company in relation to the event topic
      %li Identify senior executives with the target job titles for the topic
    %br
    %p Each event topic is unique which is why a bespoke research service is required for each event.

    %h2 Primary & Secondary market
    %p Before starting a research project, we analyse each conference the topic, the delegate profiles and sponsorship profiles to ensure we understand the nuances in each profile and the types of companies that could be targeted.
    %br 
    %p We distinguish Primary and Secondary markets by the commercial relationships between companies, as they relate the the conference topic or concept...similar to buy and sell­side dynamics in a market...but specific to each conference topic.
    %br
    %h3 Primary Markets a re ‘end­users’ or ‘buyers’. 
    %p We understand that organisers need to attract a large number of primary market delegates in order to attract sponsors. We work hand­in­hand with you to ensure that this is achieved quickly so that you’re not in a chicken and egg situation trying to close sponsors without adequate delegate numbers.
    %br
    %h3 Secondary Markets
    %p Profiles consist of solution providers, consultants or vendors...any company that sells services or products to the primary market and has a commercial interest to network with the primary market delegates. We understand that you’re offering them a solution to raise their profile, demonstrate thought leadership, align their senior management team with the event and increase their brand awareness.
