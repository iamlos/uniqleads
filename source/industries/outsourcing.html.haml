    %h2 Challenges with outsourcing
    %p Outsourcing is not without its challenges—confidentiality threats, operational dependencies, divided loyalty and a ‘loss of control’. The choice of a quality solution provider with a proven track record supplemented by clear communication of business needs and deliverables can help alleviate these challenges.
    %p Further, we also analyse the sustainability of each potential client’s business case before we accept them as a customer. We also do not accept short­term or one off engagements. Nor will we accept a client whose needs we can’t meet.
    %p Our stringent SLAs ensure business objectives are met, without exception, and the diligent implementation of an outsourcing relationship can ensure that SMEs grow their businesses exponentially and without an adverse effect on the quality of service their company provides.
