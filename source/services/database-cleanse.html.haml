    %h2 Case Study
    %p A conference company in London wanted to change the structure of their CRM system from Customers as Individuals ( one­to­one relationship) to C ustomers as Companies ( one­to­many relationship). We did the bulk of the grunt work cleaning up their database of 500,000 contacts and 90,000 companies, across 15 countries and importing it into their new CRM ­ it took us two months and had a 98% accuracy rate!
