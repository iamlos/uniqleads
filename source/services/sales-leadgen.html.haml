    %h2 Automation
    %p We have integrated these CRM systems with the best­-of­-breed marketing automation solution Act­On.com, which we believe is the best marketing automation solution for the conference industry because of its pricing model and due to its ability to assign Lead Scores on Contacts, based on individual campaigns as opposed to a lifetime behaviour score. This allows sales teams to prioritise warm to hot marketing leads and increase their efficiency.
    %p Whether you need to centralise your database, automate your marketing systems, develop the ability to track prospects on your websites or looking for an integrated sales and marketing solution, we can assist by customising a technology solution which develops your organisation’s lead generation ability so your sales team does less cold calling.

    %h2 Why salespeople must be specialists
    %p Lumping a mix of different sales activities (such as raw web lead qualification, cold calling, closing, and account management) into a general ‘sales’ role is one of the biggest productivity killers and is inefficient. It means:
    %ul
      %li Identify and remove duplicates
      %li Identify and tag similar records
      %li Correct and complete address and phone fields
      %li Remove obsolete data
      %li CRM / ERP system migration projects
      %li Verification of email address
      %li Mailing list cleanup

    %p Breaking your sales processes into different steps means keeping track of key metrics throughout the sales cycle
