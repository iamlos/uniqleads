    %h2 CRM Automation
    %p We have custom built CRM systems including NetSuite and SugarCRM for commercial conference companies, PCOs, publishers and industry associations.
    %p We have integrated these CRM systems with the best­of­breed marketing automation solution Act­On.com, which we believe is the best marketing automation solution for the conference industry because of its pricing model and due to its ability to assign Lead Scores on Contacts, based on individual campaigns as opposed to a lifetime behaviour score. This allows sales teams to prioritise warm to hot marketing leads and increase their efficiency.
    %p Whether you need to centralise your database, automate your marketing systems, develop the ability to track prospects on your websites or looking for an integrated sales and marketing solution, we can assist by customising a technology solution which develops your organisation’s lead generation ability so your sales team does less cold calling.
